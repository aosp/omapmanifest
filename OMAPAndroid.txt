Welcome to Android on OMAP RLS25.5rc2

You can find an OMAP specific kernel under kernel.
The first and second stage bootloaders (x-loader and u-boot) can be
found in the bootloader directory

Additional Patches needed.
Note: These patches must be manually added after the repo sync.  To
  install, cd to the associated patch path and do the git pull.
  i.e.: if the path is git://server.com/platform/frameworks/base -
    you will need to cd to framework/base and do the git pull
    from that directory.
